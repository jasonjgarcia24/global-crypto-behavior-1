To access trace `meta` in\n            layout attributes, use `%{data[n[.meta[i]}` where `i`\n            is the index or key of the `meta` and `n` is the trace\n            index.\n        metasrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            meta .\n        name\n            Sets the trace name. The trace name appear as the\n            legend item and on hover.\n        offset\n            Shifts the position where the bar is drawn (in position\n            axis units). In \"group\" barmode, traces that set\n            \"offset\" will be excluded and drawn in \"overlay\" mode\n            instead.\n        offsetgroup\n            Set several traces linked to the same position axis or\n            matching axes to the same offsetgroup where bars of the\n            same position coordinate will line up.\n        offsetsrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            offset .\n        opacity\n            Sets the opacity of the trace.\n        orientation\n            Sets the orientation of the bars.

If\n            a single string, the same string appears over all the\n            data points. If an array of string, the items are\n            mapped in order to the this trace's (x,y) coordinates.\n            If trace `hoverinfo` contains a \"text\" flag and\n            \"hovertext\" is not set, these elements will be seen in\n            the hover labels.\n        textangle\n            Sets the angle of the tick labels with respect to the\n            bar. For example, a `tickangle` of -90 draws the tick\n            labels vertically. With \"auto\" the texts may\n            automatically be rotated to fit with the maximum size\n            in bars.\n        textfont\n            Sets the font used for `text`.\n        textposition\n            Specifies the location of the `text`. \"inside\"\n            positions `text` inside, next to the bar end (rotated\n            and scaled if needed). \"outside\" positions `text`\n            outside, next to the bar end (scaled if needed), unless\n            there is another bar stacked on this one, then the text\n            gets pushed inside. \"auto\" tries to position `text`\n            inside the bar, but if the bar is too small and no bar\n            is stacked on this one the text is moved outside. If\n            \"none\", no text appears.\n        textpositionsrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            textposition .\n        textsrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            text .\n        texttemplate\n            Template string used for rendering the information text\n            that appear on points. Note that this will override\n            `textinfo`. Variables are inserted using %{variable},\n            for example \"y: %{y}\". Numbers are formatted using\n            d3-format's syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for example\n            \"Price: %{y:$.2f}\". https://github.com/d3/d3-3.x-api-\n            reference/blob/master/Formatting.md#d3_format for\n            details on the formatting syntax. Dates are formatted\n            using d3-time-format's syntax %{variable|d3-time-\n            format}, for example \"Day: %{2019-01-01|%A}\".\n            https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format#locale_format for\n            details on the date formatting syntax.

Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.\n            Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are\n            controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is\n            controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,\n            `selectedpoints` is controlled by\n            `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)`\n            (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is\n            controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are\n            tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index\n            if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove\n            traces before the end of the `data` array, such that\n            the same trace has a different index, you can still\n            preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a\n            `uid` that stays with it as it moves.\n        unselected\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.bar.Unselected` instance\n            or dict with compatible properties\n        visible\n            Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If\n            \"legendonly\", the trace is not drawn, but can appear as\n            a legend item (provided that the legend itself is\n            visible).\n        width\n            Sets the bar width (in position axis units).\n        widthsrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            width .\n        x\n            Sets the x coordinates.\n        x0\n            Alternate to `x`.

Use with `dx` where `x0` is the starting\n            coordinate and `dx` the step.\n        xaxis\n            Sets a reference between this trace's x coordinates and\n            a 2D cartesian x axis. If \"x\" (the default value), the\n            x coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis`. If \"x2\", the x\n            coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis2`, and so on.\n        xcalendar\n            Sets the calendar system to use with `x` date data.\n        xhoverformat\n            Sets the hover text formatting rulefor `x`  using d3\n            formatting mini-languages which are very similar to\n            those in Python.

With \"v\" (\"h\"), the\n            value of the each bar spans along the vertical\n            (horizontal).\n        outsidetextfont\n            Sets the font used for `text` lying outside the bar.\n        selected\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.bar.Selected` instance or\n            dict with compatible properties\n        selectedpoints\n            Array containing integer indices of selected points.\n            Has an effect only for traces that support selections.\n            Note that an empty array means an empty selection where\n            the `unselected` are turned on for all points, whereas,\n            any other non-array values means no selection all where\n            the `selected` and `unselected` styles have no effect.\n        showlegend\n            Determines whether or not an item corresponding to this\n            trace is shown in the legend.\n        stream\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.bar.Stream` instance or\n            dict with compatible properties\n        text\n            Sets text elements associated with each (x,y) pair. If\n            a single string, the same string appears over all the\n            data points. If an array of string, the items are\n            mapped in order to the this trace's (x,y) coordinates.\n            If trace `hoverinfo` contains a \"text\" flag and\n            \"hovertext\" is not set, these elements will be seen in\n            the hover labels.\n        textangle\n            Sets the angle of the tick labels with respect to the\n            bar. For example, a `tickangle` of -90 draws the tick\n            labels vertically. With \"auto\" the texts may\n            automatically be rotated to fit with the maximum size\n            in bars.\n        textfont\n            Sets the font used for `text`.\n        textposition\n            Specifies the location of the `text`. \"inside\"\n            positions `text` inside, next to the bar end (rotated\n            and scaled if needed). \"outside\" positions `text`\n            outside, next to the bar end (scaled if needed), unless\n            there is another bar stacked on this one, then the text\n            gets pushed inside. \"auto\" tries to position `text`\n            inside the bar, but if the bar is too small and no bar\n            is stacked on this one the text is moved outside. If\n            \"none\", no text appears.\n        textpositionsrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            textposition .\n        textsrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            text .\n        texttemplate\n            Template string used for rendering the information text\n            that appear on points. Note that this will override\n            `textinfo`. Variables are inserted using %{variable},\n            for example \"y: %{y}\". Numbers are formatted using\n            d3-format's syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for example\n            \"Price: %{y:$.2f}\". https://github.com/d3/d3-3.x-api-\n            reference/blob/master/Formatting.md#d3_format for\n            details on the formatting syntax. Dates are formatted\n            using d3-time-format's syntax %{variable|d3-time-\n            format}, for example \"Day: %{2019-01-01|%A}\".\n            https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format#locale_format for\n            details on the date formatting syntax. Every attributes\n            that can be specified per-point (the ones that are\n            `arrayOk: true`) are available. variables `value` and\n            `label`.\n        texttemplatesrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            texttemplate .\n        uid\n            Assign an id to this trace, Use this to provide object\n            constancy between traces during animations and\n            transitions.\n        uirevision\n            Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the\n            trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well\n            as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name`\n            and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.\n            Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are\n            controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is\n            controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,\n            `selectedpoints` is controlled by\n            `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)`\n            (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is\n            controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are\n            tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index\n            if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove\n            traces before the end of the `data` array, such that\n            the same trace has a different index, you can still\n            preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a\n            `uid` that stays with it as it moves.\n        unselected\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.bar.Unselected` instance\n            or dict with compatible properties\n        visible\n            Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If\n            \"legendonly\", the trace is not drawn, but can appear as\n            a legend item (provided that the legend itself is\n            visible).\n        width\n            Sets the bar width (in position axis units).\n        widthsrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            width .\n        x\n            Sets the x coordinates.\n        x0\n            Alternate to `x`. Builds a linear space of x\n            coordinates. Use with `dx` where `x0` is the starting\n            coordinate and `dx` the step.\n        xaxis\n            Sets a reference between this trace's x coordinates and\n            a 2D cartesian x axis. If \"x\" (the default value), the\n            x coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis`. If \"x2\", the x\n            coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis2`, and so on.\n        xcalendar\n            Sets the calendar system to use with `x` date data.\n        xhoverformat\n            Sets the hover text formatting rulefor `x`  using d3\n            formatting mini-languages which are very similar to\n            those in Python. For numbers, see:\n            https://github.com/d3/d3-3.x-api-\n            reference/blob/master/Formatting.md#d3_format. And for\n            dates see: https://github.com/d3/d3-time-\n            format#locale_format. We add two items to d3's date\n            formatter: \"%h\" for half of the year as a decimal\n            number as well as \"%{n}f\" for fractional seconds with n\n            digits. For example, *2016-10-13 09:15:23.456* with\n            tickformat \"%H~%M~%S.%2f\" would display *09~15~23.46*By\n            default the values are formatted using\n            `xaxis.hoverformat`.\n        xperiod\n            Only relevant when the axis `type` is \"date\".

Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.\n            Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are\n            controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is\n            controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,\n            `selectedpoints` is controlled by\n            `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)`\n            (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is\n            controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are\n            tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index\n            if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove\n            traces before the end of the `data` array, such that\n            the same trace has a different index, you can still\n            preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a\n            `uid` that stays with it as it moves.\n        unselected\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.bar.Unselected` instance\n            or dict with compatible properties\n        visible\n            Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If\n            \"legendonly\", the trace is not drawn, but can appear as\n            a legend item (provided that the legend itself is\n            visible).\n        width\n            Sets the bar width (in position axis units).\n        widthsrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            width .\n        x\n            Sets the x coordinates.\n        x0\n            Alternate to `x`.

If \"x\" (the default value), the\n            x coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis`.

If\n            \"none\", no text appears.\n        textpositionsrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            textposition .\n        textsrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            text .\n        texttemplate\n            Template string used for rendering the information text\n            that appear on points. Note that this will override\n            `textinfo`. Variables are inserted using %{variable},\n            for example \"y: %{y}\". Numbers are formatted using\n            d3-format's syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for example\n            \"Price: %{y:$.2f}\". https://github.com/d3/d3-3.x-api-\n            reference/blob/master/Formatting.md#d3_format for\n            details on the formatting syntax. Dates are formatted\n            using d3-time-format's syntax %{variable|d3-time-\n            format}, for example \"Day: %{2019-01-01|%A}\".\n            https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format#locale_format for\n            details on the date formatting syntax. Every attributes\n            that can be specified per-point (the ones that are\n            `arrayOk: true`) are available. variables `value` and\n            `label`.\n        texttemplatesrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            texttemplate .\n        uid\n            Assign an id to this trace, Use this to provide object\n            constancy between traces during animations and\n            transitions.\n        uirevision\n            Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the\n            trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well\n            as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name`\n            and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.\n            Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are\n            controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is\n            controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,\n            `selectedpoints` is controlled by\n            `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)`\n            (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is\n            controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are\n            tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index\n            if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove\n            traces before the end of the `data` array, such that\n            the same trace has a different index, you can still\n            preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a\n            `uid` that stays with it as it moves.\n        unselected\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.bar.Unselected` instance\n            or dict with compatible properties\n        visible\n            Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If\n            \"legendonly\", the trace is not drawn, but can appear as\n            a legend item (provided that the legend itself is\n            visible).\n        width\n            Sets the bar width (in position axis units).\n        widthsrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            width .\n        x\n            Sets the x coordinates.\n        x0\n            Alternate to `x`.

If \"x\" (the default value), the\n            x coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis`. If \"x2\", the x\n            coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis2`, and so on.\n        xcalendar\n            Sets the calendar system to use with `x` date data.\n        xhoverformat\n            Sets the hover text formatting rulefor `x`  using d3\n            formatting mini-languages which are very similar to\n            those in Python.
